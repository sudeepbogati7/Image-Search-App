# Image-Search-App

<p>
  A well functioning responsive image search app .<br>
  <br>
  You can search images by simply typing image related name on the search box . I have used <a href = "unsplash.com"> unsplash.com </a> website's API .<br><br>
  Here's the link to this application : <a href= "https://sudeepbogati7.github.io/Image-Search-App/">https://sudeepbogati7.github.io/Image-Search-App/</a>
